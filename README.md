# Portfolio of sample code

1) You will find example IaaC Bicep files for Azure deployments. This is example code designed
to give you a taste of how I leverage IaaC in my practice. 
2) Databricks is all scala code. I like scala becuase of 'case classes' and static typing.
This code is raw, meaning its code I wrote as a tool to transform and load data that was living
on our ADLS2 environment.
4) Snowflake code shows how I built an Hl7 parser. The scope was narrow but functional
