-- Step 1: Analyze Query
-- Identify the query that needs optimization.
-- Analyze the query execution plan to understand its structure.

-- Step 2: Review Schema and Table Design
-- Ensure tables are appropriately structured with proper data types and indexes.
-- Normalize or denormalize tables based on access patterns.
-- Distribute data properly across clusters using clustering keys.

-- Step 3: Use EXPLAIN PLAN
-- Use the EXPLAIN PLAN statement to understand how Snowflake plans to execute your query.
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR :your_query;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(EXPLAIN_RESULT());

-- Step 4: Profile Query Performance
-- Use the PROFILE parameter to collect performance statistics.
SELECT /*+ PROFILE */ * FROM your_table WHERE :conditions;

-- Step 5: Indexing
-- Create indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
CREATE INDEX idx_column ON your_table(column);

-- Step 6: Partitioning and Clustering
-- Partition large tables to reduce data processing per query.
-- Cluster tables based on frequently joined columns to improve query performance.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE your_table
CLUSTER BY (:cluster_column)
AS
SELECT * FROM your_source_table;

-- Step 7: Materialized Views
-- Create materialized views for complex queries to precompute results.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name AS
SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE :conditions;

-- Step 8: Query Rewriting
-- Rewrite queries to use efficient techniques like EXISTS, IN, JOINs, etc.
-- Avoid using SELECT *; specify only necessary columns.
-- Use subqueries judiciously.

-- Step 9: Cache Query Results
-- Use result caching for frequently executed queries.
SELECT /*+ RESULT_CACHE */ * FROM your_table WHERE :conditions;

-- Step 10: Monitor and Fine-tune
-- Continuously monitor query performance using Snowflake's query history and performance monitoring tools.
-- Adjust your optimization strategies based on real-world query patterns.

-- Step 11: Use Snowflake Features
-- Utilize Snowflake-specific features like automatic query optimization, auto-clustering, and Snowflake's query profiler.

-- Step 12: Workload Management (WLM)
-- Configure WLM settings to prioritize and allocate resources to different query types.
-- Use resource classes to manage concurrency and resource allocation.

-- Step 13: Utilize Snowflake Functions
-- Use built-in functions like TRY_CAST, DATE_TRUNC, etc., to manipulate and transform data efficiently.

-- Step 14: Avoid Cartesian Joins
-- Be cautious with Cartesian joins, as they can cause a significant performance hit.

-- Step 15: Scale Up or Out
-- Consider scaling up (increasing the size of the virtual warehouse) or scaling out (using multi-cluster warehouses) for resource-intensive queries.

-- Step 16: Collaboration
-- Collaborate with your Snowflake support team to get expert advice on specific query performance challenges.

-- Step 17: Regularly Review and Optimize
-- Query performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly review and refine your strategies based on changing query patterns and data volumes.
